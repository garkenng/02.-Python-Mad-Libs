02. Codecademy---Python-Mad-Libs
Second project in the codecademy. Using Pythonto write a Mad Libs work game. The game consists of a short story where the user fills in the blank spaces.
An example of the output is:
This morning John woke up feeling heavy. 'It is going to be a big day!' Outside, a bunch of dogs were protesting to keep curry in stores. They began to jump to the rhythm of the hat, which made all the apples very smooth. Concerned, John texted batman, who flew John to UK and dropped John in a puddle of frozen ice cream. John woke up in the year 2022, in a world where cars ruled the world.

interesting Story!
